    <h1> In “The Ones Who Walk Away From Omelas” by Ursula K. Leguin, she describes a virtually perfect society. A happy society, one that claims to find meaning not in pain, but in union, in celebration of life. It is not a puritan society, devoid of pleasure, nor is it led by a cult. The society is built on a single exchange; The happiness of nearly all its citizens, in exchange for the absolute lack of happiness for one. A child trapped in terrible conditions, allowed not a single word of kindness.</h1><br>
    <h2> Many in the city, when they first learn of the child, rage against the injustice. Many are uncomfortable with the stark contrast to the rest of the city. Yet, as time goes on, and they wrestle with the paradox, they rationalize. They come to terms with the fact that, should they help in any way, society will change for the worse for nearly everyone they know. This sobering fact lies at the heart of their happiness, aiding their compassion towards their fellow citizens. Some of them, however, respond differently to the situation. Those that choose to leave the city, rejecting the deal for themselves, and seeking something else.</h2><br>
    <h3> One group decides that the trade off is acceptable for the happiness it brings the city; that the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the one. The other group rejects the deal. Though it is not explicitly stated, those that leave go towards “a place even less imaginable to most of us than [Omelas]”. What could be harder to imagine than a place of almost paradise? Those that leave seek something better than Omelas, because they are unsatisfied with the city after discovering the tragedy at its core.</h3><br>
    <h4> Two ways of responding to a terrible truth. Accept it and make honest peace with the decision to fuel the city off one person’s suffering? Or reject it, do nothing beyond leaving and looking for a better solution? Is there a correct answer? Of course not, the story wouldn’t be interesting if it had a universal answer. But which is more correct? To suffer for consistent morality? To accept that the child’s situation will not meaningfully improve, so the city might as well enjoy the benefits? </h4><br>
    <strong> Both of the presented ways of responding to the situation in Omelas are selfish </strong>
