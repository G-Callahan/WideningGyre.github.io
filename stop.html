      <b> Using Data-based approaches to assess and combat ethnic, racial, and other forms of discrimination by Oregon law enforcement is an excellent start, but the data indicates there is room to improve.</b>
      <p> The Statistical Transparency of Policing Report (with the wonderful acronym of STOP) is a report published by the Oregon government, reporting data on law enforcement initiated traffic and pedestrian stops, with the intention of analyzing the data for disparities based on racial or ethnic reasons. While the data from the STOP Report on the Logistic Regression of Latinx Drivers largely looks good, there is at least one notable, statistically significant department that could use some attention to ensure that law efforcement officers aren't stopping people for discriminatory reasons. Furthermore, though they do well so far in the data they collect, the Oregon government must be vigilent in its goal, because collecting data might change the nature of possible discrimination. For example, recording the annual quantity of stops of a particular ethnicity might show improvement, but if the data doesn't capture the intensity of the repurcussions of the stops, discrimination might slip by unadressed. (This is an example, the STOP report includes analysis on Stop Outcomes).</p>
      <p>In the graph below, which details the Logistic Regression of stops for Latinx Drivers, only the Sandy PD of the 31 agencies was noted to have a statistically significant difference in Latinx stops compared to white stops. Though both the Phoenix PD and Gervais PD had a higher ratio, the statistical significance of both was reduced due to a Bonferroni Correction based on the number of comparisons. This correction reduced their numbers below the 'statistically significant' threshold.</p>
    <div id="chart_div" style="width: 900px; height: 700px;"></div>
      <p>This graph alone is not an indicator of success. It is only one of the three metrics the report looked at, with the three being the Decision to Stop, Stop Outcomes, and Search Findings. While no department failed two or more metrics, failing a single metric isn't good for a department, especially since the Decision to Stop metric is held up as the "gold standard" among law enforcement data analysis.</p>
      <p>The Decision to Stop data relies on drivers keeping a relatively consistant driving schedule throughout the year at dawn and dusk, while the light level changes due to longer or shorter days. This allows officers to either see the drivers more clearly, or not be able to see them (and thus, not be able to determine the race of the driver for potential discrimination). In the context of Facebook not serving housing ads to specific ethnic groups, is there a similar method that could be used to test ads? Perhaps a way of changing or hiding a potential customers' ethnicity, but keeping the rest of their data profile the same?</p>
