  <p>In current times, it's a fact of life that most large technology companies are up to no good. If they're not peddling political propaganda across social media networks, censoring content for consumers, or deriving a database of dossiers, big tech companies are using their tech in ethically dubious ways in order to make money.</p>
  <b>The US government, in a shockingly rare display of modern literacy, is suing and settling an agreement with Meta Platforms Inc (Facebook) in order to ensure that Facebooks' advertisements don't sidestep discrimination laws. </b>
  <p>Facebook used a way of delivering ads to consumers that relied on race, sex, and other federally protected classes in order to advertise houses. By delivering housing ads to some customers but not others based on race, Facebook has run afoul of anti-discrimination laws in a very tangible way. </p>
  <p>Though Facebook has recently settled a few lawsuits for just under $5 million dollars, this is not the first time they've faced issues. Apparently, facebook has been facing housing discrimination allegations for years, but they're definitely changing this time, we promise. They "can do better". Wonder why they bother saying they can do better if they haven't bothered to do so. Really just rubbing their lack of ethics in everyone's face, aren't they?</p>
  <p>Given that Meta had a yearly revenue of $116 billion in 2022 and that the maximum penalty under the Fair Housing ACt is $115,054, isn't that penalty barely a slap on the wrist? Does that penalty seem like much of a deterant? What about the $5 million settlements? Are these low low cost penalties just the cost of doing buisness for tech giants? Why would they change their behaviour if they stand to make more money than these penalties cost? What would be a more effective way to change these companies' behaviour?</p>
  <p>Has enough of a pattern of tech giant's behaviour emerged that it's worth being proactive to keep these companies using their products and tools ethically?</p>
  <p>Thankfully, Kristen Clarke, the Assistant Attorney General of the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division thinks so. With the settlement looming, the Justice Department committed to holding companies accountable for the use of their tools in a non discriminatory manner. Only time will tell if these lawsuits and settlements have teeth, but hopefully they serve to keep some of the more 'morally flexible' tech companies in line with laws.</p>
