<p>Artifical intelligence is providing alternate options for learning in classrooms. Neurodiverse students, such as those with autism or adhd, often struggle to keep up with their neurotypical peers, but AI can provide tools and alternate learning solutions. For example, InnerVoice is an app that can recognize and label images from a phone's camera. Additionally, though it's not limited to students, Salesforce has created a summarization technology for compressing large bodies of text into more understandable paragraphs.</p>
<p>Additionally, though such schooling challenges in the past impacted neurodivergent people, companies are now recognizing that they have strengths of their own to contribute. With AI suppoort, neurodivergent workers can be more effective in some cases than neurotypical workers, or provide a different, valuable perspective.</p>
<p>Finally, deque provides a number of possible accessibility problems that technology is solving at the moment. From alt text on images to help visually impaired people, to improving captions via lip-reading, to real time translation from other languages.</p>
<b>AI is such an incredible tool at this point, solving an incredible number of problems and only getting better, that it looks like the singularity is approaching much more rapidly. </b>
